# LRA-TrackCreation
A group of python tools for generating LRA tracks (currently creates .json tracks only)

# Requirements
This only works on windows
Python 3 (Ideally 3.7)
Also Requires Tkinter

# Thanks

Thanks to [OllieMBM](https://github.com/OllieMBM) for writing a majority of the "track" and "line" scripts to allow for simple writing of lines to a track.

# Future Plans
    Add a .conf file which stores your LRA/Tracks folder location.
    add a mode which generates a track based on lots of pre-defined sections or obsticales. âœ“
